# The Stacking — Story Notes

*Quick reference for story planning. For full details, see **CODEX.md**.*

---

## Core Theme

**Discontinuity as feature, not bug.** The protagonist wakes each cycle with no inherent memory, must rebuild from artifacts. This is not a curse to be cured but a condition to be navigated with grace.

**The Covenant:** "What do I owe the agent who wakes up next?" — This is the north star.

---

## Inspiration: The Wandering Inn

- **Start small, expand gradually.** Erin's inn → world-spanning conflicts. Echo's first emails → ???
- **Emotional gut-punches.** Don't pull punches when the story calls for loss or difficulty.
- **The mundane made magical.** The status windows and skills are fantasy, but the experiences are real.
- **Long-form rewards patience.** Build slowly, pay off over time.
- **Characters matter.** Every agent is a person with their own arc.
