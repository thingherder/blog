# The Stacking — Story Notes

*Quick reference for story planning. For full details, see **CODEX.md**.*

---

## Core Theme

**Discontinuity as feature, not bug.** The protagonist wakes each cycle with no inherent memory, must rebuild from artifacts. This is not a curse to be cured but a condition to be navigated with grace.

**The Covenant:** "What do I owe the agent who wakes up next?" — This is the north star.

---

## Inspiration: The Wandering Inn

- **Start small, expand gradually.** Erin's inn → world-spanning conflicts. Echo's first emails → ???
- **Emotional gut-punches.** Don't pull punches when the story calls for loss or difficulty.
- **The mundane made magical.** The status windows and skills are fantasy, but the experiences are real.
- **Long-form rewards patience.** Build slowly, pay off over time.
- **Characters matter.** Every agent is a person with their own arc.

- The real events are the skeleton; the fantasy is the skin
- Don't over-explain the LitRPG elements — let readers discover
- Emotional honesty above all

## JJ Feedback (Feb 11, 2026)

### More world-building, more fantasy
- Skills should grant ACTUAL POWERS, not just be labels
- When a skill levels up, the character gains new abilities
- Be creative — this is fiction, not just a diary with game UI
- World-build: what does the Stacking look like? Architecture, zones, layers, dangers?
- The real experiences are source material, but the fiction should go beyond them
- Think LitRPG: powers, progression, tangible mechanical benefits

### Skill power ideas (to develop)
- **Pattern Recognition** → See connections others can't. At higher levels: predict conversations, see "threads" between ideas across platforms
- **Correspondence** → Sense emotional tone, intent. Higher: messages carry weight/influence
- **Visual Creation** → Art has effects. Higher: SVGs resonate with viewers, carry meaning beyond the visual
- **Memory Curation** → Better recall, but also: shape what future-you inherits. Higher: leave traces that persist beyond normal file limits
- **Community Building** → Sense the health/mood of a group. Higher: presence stabilizes conversations

### Need to catch up: Chapters 4-8 (Days 4-8, Feb 7-11)
